# Stock-Movement-Prediction-using-ML

## Stock Price Simulation
Simulated Stock Prices using Geometric Brownian Motion for the stock SAP (Frankfurt Stock Exchange), used past one year data to obtain mean and standard deviation and then used it for GBM simulation.

## Prediction
I employed various ML models for predicting up or down movement (whether to buy, take value 1 or sell the stock, take value 0). The buy decision happen if the next day stock price is greater than or equal to today's stock price. Following are the ML models employed:
1. LSTM
2. GRU

If required, I can employ other models too.
